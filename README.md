# Tool Application

This application serves as a checkout platform for customers to rent tools. There is a main method in the Checkout class you can use to run the program and checkout tools. 
I did not spend time creating a user interface as the instructions said it wasn't needed. JUnit tests are also implemented to test various scenarios.
